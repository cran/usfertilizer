\title{usfertilizer: County-Level Estimates of Fertilizer Application in US}
\description{
Compiled and cleaned the county-level estimates of fertilizer,
nitrogen and phosphorus, from 1945 to 2012.  The dataset were originally
generated by USGS based on the sales data of commercial fertilizer.
See <https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5851b2d1e4b0f99207c4f238/> for details.
Usfertilizer utilized the tidyverse to clean the original data and provide
user-friendly dataframe. Please note that USGS does not endorse this package and this package
does not include manure data. Also data from 1986 is not available for now.
